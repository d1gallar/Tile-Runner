# Tile Runner

## How to Play
Race to slide the colored tiles and try to find a matching pattern in the smallest amount of time! There are 24 colored tiles and one empty space. The player is allowed to slide each tile horizontally or vertically. After the board is scrambled a timer will start and you will have to find a match for the 3 x 3 pattern shown on top. The game will finish until the inner square of the given board matches the colored pattern on the top. The game will not finish if you create a colored match that touches any of the outer tiles of the board. Once you have matched the pattern, play again to see if you can solve the pattern at a faster speed!
